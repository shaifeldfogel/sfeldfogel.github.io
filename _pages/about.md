I study interface failure mechanisms in diverse structural applications, ranging from adhesively bonded tiles and sandwich structures, where the interfacial failure is governed by tensile and shear tractions, to topologically interlocked discrete assemblies, where contact and friction interfacial interactions are key. Common to both cases is the tendency of the interface mechanisms to become unstable when a critical load is reached, propagate dynamically, and often be catastrophic from a structural integrity point of view. Also, they are typically governed by localized effects, and they are by nature 2D and geometrically irregular. These features define the modeling challenges that make them notoriously difficult to model, quantify, and understand. My approach to facing these challenges and to gain a better understanding and insight into interface failure in structures is to develop and employ specially tailored computational platforms, specifically designed to account for the salient features of each structural applicaiton. These include FEM multilayered plate models for tension/shear governed interfacial debonding mechanisms, and state of the art DEM formulations for contact/friction governed collaplse mechanicsms in topologically interlocked discrete structures.
